# ZeitMicroService
Exploration into Zeit Micro with Micro-Dev

The plan is to branch specific reusable micro service logic (public domain) to speed up future app dev. 

Possible future Docker support, for now, I'm leveraging ZEIT Now services to explore their deploy using an OSS account with simple Node.js solutions.

## History
Previously, I explored Resin.IO for distribution across RaspberryPi devices with Node.js solutions and an AWS hosted API suite. All work
herein aims to reduce overhead cost, increase scalability, and continue to secure all data in transit and at rest.
